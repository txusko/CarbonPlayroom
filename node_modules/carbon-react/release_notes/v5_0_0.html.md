# v5.0.0 (2018-10-08)
### Improvements
* [1832](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/pull/1832) - Remove Parcelify Loader, and use webpack to load component CSS / Sass.
* [1843](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/pull/1843) Added AutoScroll option to Draggable Context that makes it scrollable when dragging
* Added 4 new icons to the icon font and updated the cross icon weight to be thicker.
* [1133](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/pull/1133) - Remove core-js dependency and promise polyfill. If you were using the promise polyfill from Carbon previously we recommend using the polyfill from babel or from core-js manually. carbon-factory v6.1.0 provides a preconfigured `.babelrc` file for this.

### Bug Fixes
* [1834](https://github.com/Sage/carbon/pull/1834) - Fix issue which caused error message on input validation to flicker on mouse over.
* Dropdown: Resolves warning - Each child in an array or iterator should have a unique 'key' prop.

### Dependency Updates
* Upgrade carbon-factory to v5.2.1, which enables source maps by default in the webpack config.
